# data_engineering_beginner
Creating a data pipeline to extract **data** unsing the **spotify api** and save the songs listened to everyday into a local **sqlite db**.  
I achieved this project by following Karolina's [data engineering for beginners' course.](https://github.com/karolina-sowinska/free-data-engineering-course-for-beginners) I highly recommend you check her [Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAxnMry1lETl47xQWABvH7g)
